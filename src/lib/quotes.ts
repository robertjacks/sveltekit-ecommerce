I have only seen a few of your larger paintings in the flesh, but have been bowled over. I also love how you have managed to do the Artists’ Support Pledge, to make affordable work yet keep absolute integrity with your general practice. And clearly I’m not the only one who thinks that!",

I just wanted you to know your collage arrived safely today (that was quick!). In person it has an unexpected presence, so deep and intimate. In fact, its very profound. I feel transported to a place of peace through this. Somehow I knew.. thank you. I will treasure this work.",
